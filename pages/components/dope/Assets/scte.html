            As a non-profit entity whose board includes companies like Comcast and <br> Charter Communications, 
            the client was under constant pressure to deliver <br> maximum value from the products and services it offers. 
            Several prior <br> attempts to automate core business functions and move them to the cloud <br> had failed.
             The client had a strong in-house IT team but no authoritative <br> plan for the future, 
             and was rapidly losing ground to competitors due to the <br> accrual of technical debt.

            Due to both the complexity of the data manipulation required and the aging <br> nature of its satellite systems, 
            SCTE needed a game changer. Because <br> previous efforts had failed, 
            the client was  well behind schedule and was <br> understandably skeptical of new partners.

            The client elected to begin with a project that was somewhat narrow in <br> scope,
             but which required advanced calculation and algorithm <br> development capabilities. <br><br>

            These skills would be critical to the successful realization of its new online <br> presence,
             so they made a logical place to start. 
             We first worked with the <br> client to create a completely new product – a web application that <br> leveraged member activity,
              certification, and learning to provide them with a <br> personal performance dashboard. <br> <br>
            
            We then helped the SCTE team to establish the raw formulas used to <br> determine personal progress
             and performance against the average <br> individual in their particular skill set. The dashboard we
              developed also <br> identified areas which may need improvement, informed users how they <br> used their career development time,
               and offered LMS coursework available <br> for purchase that intended to help the user. <br><br>

            This broader initiative was intended to yield
             a <br> dramatic change in the efficiency and 
             perceived <br> value of the client's business processes. <br><br>

            Its scope included a complete overhaul of user <br> interface for the client's key products,
             and <br> collaborating with the client's internal
              teams to <br> create refined user experiences for all of its member <br> touchpoints. <br><br>
            
            These various applications and website consoles <br> had to be capable of sharing infrastructure, 
            source <br> code, and API endpoints to the fullest extent <br> possible, 
            but traditional approaches to data storage, <br> computation, 
            and integration simply weren't up to <br> the task. <br><br>

            The most complicated and resource intensive project was the client's new <br> website.
             Interface limitations, third party dependencies, unstable API <br> resources,
              and corrupted data were just a few 
              of the symptoms of technical <br> debt that constantly required attention.
